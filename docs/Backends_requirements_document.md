### Fantasy Crypto Exchange Simulator - Backend Requirements Document (Revised)

**Project Overview:**
The Fantasy Crypto Exchange Simulator is a web-based platform offering a simulated environment for cryptocurrency trading. The backend is essential for driving the simulation, handling dynamic data, user interactions, and simulating market conditions. This revised document presents the requirements for backend development, now to be implemented using Node.js and Express.

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **User Management:**
   - Handle user registration, authentication, and profile management.
   - Securely store user data, including hashed passwords and personal information.
   - Implement JWT for secure and stateless user authentication.

2. **Cryptocurrency Data Management:**
   - Fetch real-time and historical data of cryptocurrencies via external APIs or a predefined dataset.
   - Simulate cryptocurrency price fluctuations.
   - Store and manage historical price data for each cryptocurrency.

3. **Portfolio Management:**
   - Enable users to view and manage their cryptocurrency portfolios.
   - Record and reflect user transactions (buying and selling simulated cryptocurrency) in the portfolio.
   - Calculate and display portfolio value based on current simulated market prices.

4. **Market Simulation:**
   - Develop an algorithm to simulate realistic market fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices.

5. **Transaction Processing:**
   - Facilitate user buy and sell orders.
   - Update user balances and portfolios post-transactions.
   - Validate transactions for criteria like sufficient balance and valid amounts.

6. **API Endpoints:**
   - Create RESTful API endpoints for frontend interactions.
   - Include endpoints for user registration/login, fetching cryptocurrency data, executing transactions, and accessing user portfolios.

7. **Transaction History:**
   - Maintain and display a history of user transactions, showing past buys and sells with associated prices.

8. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - Implement robust error handling for APIs.
   - Log key system events and errors for monitoring and debugging.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

1. **Performance:**
   - Handle multiple concurrent user requests efficiently.
   - Optimize database interactions for speed.

2. **Security:**
   - Protect sensitive data with robust security measures.
   - Use HTTPS for all API endpoints and regularly update dependencies to address vulnerabilities.

3. **Scalability:**
   - Design a backend capable of scaling with user and data growth.

4. **Reliability:**
   - Ensure consistent backend service availability.
   - Plan appropriate data backup and recovery methods.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Provide detailed API documentation, including endpoint descriptions, request/response formats, and examples.

**Technology Stack:**
- **Node.js and Express:** Core technologies for backend development.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB (to be finalized).
- **Security:** Spring Security and JWT for authentication.
- **API Documentation:** Swagger or equivalent for documenting APIs.

**Delivery and Deployment:**
- Containerize the backend with Docker for streamlined deployment.
- Offer a Git repository with the complete source code, along with build and deployment instructions.

**Testing:**
- Conduct thorough unit and integration testing across components.
- Employ Jest for testing within the Node.js environment.
